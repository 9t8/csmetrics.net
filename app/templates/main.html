		Prospective students, parents, faculty, and University administrators use rankings to make

		publications. These metrics are  <a href="https://github.com/csmetrics/csmetrics.org/blob/master/docs/Overview.md#limitations">
		incomplete</a> because they should be combined with qualitative
		expert opinion and other metrics, such as area  citation practices, faculty  size, awards,
		student graduation rates, and PhD placement. It is a work in progress.</p>

              <p><b>Introduction to the metrics and data </b>

   		This web page computes institutional publication metrics for computer science configured by users.
                These metrics are principally focused on institutions, as opposed to faculty or authors,
                and for use in assessing both the past and predicting
                future research impact of publications.
	      We cleaned publication, venue, and institution data from DBLP and Microsoft Academic for 2007 to 2016
                appearing in 210 venues from 199 institutions. For each paper in this corpus, we divide credit equally
                among all authors and their institutions at time of publication. A publication never changes institutions and
                all authors (graduate students, post docs, faculty, undergraduates, etc.) accrue credit to their institution.</p>
              <p>Users combine a <b>measured</b> (retrospective) and
                <b>prediction</b> (prospective) metric
                 to compute an institutional measure. The measured metric uses <b>citation counts</b> and includes all citations at any time
                to papers published in the specified year range. The <b>prediction</b> metric counts papers in an independently specified year range
                and weighs them by venue.  A venue weight of one values all venues equally.
                The geometric mean venue weight assigns each venue the geometric mean of citations to papers appearing in the venue from 2007-2016,
                thus more highly cited venues weigh more.  (Venue weight is displayed next to selected venues.)</p>

	      <p> Users select year ranges for each metric and a venue weight. We suggest a disjoint range for the two metrics and that prediction only be used on recent publications
                that have not had sufficient time to accrue citations (e.g., 2014-2016).
              Users select categories to determine venues and may exclude/include individual venues to create custom
                venue lists.
                Since the metrics are not comparable, the combined metric uses geometric mean,
                where the user assigns a relative weight (alpha) to the measured and predictive metrics.</p>
