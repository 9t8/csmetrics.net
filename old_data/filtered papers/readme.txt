This directory contains all relevant conferences in our data set. Each file contains the papers that
were included in the DBLP database for the respective conference and year, but were NOT included
in our rankings. Each paper should also have one of two reasons listed as to why it was not included.
Either it was filtered out manually or it was filtered out due to a suggestive keyword in the header of
the section that the paper is listed under. This process is described further in documentation.
